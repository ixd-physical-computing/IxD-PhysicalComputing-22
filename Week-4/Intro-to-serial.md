## Introduction to Serial Communication

How does an Arduino communicate with any other device, like a computer? How do any devices communicate with each other, like a remote control to a television? One of the most common protocols for Arduino is **Serial Communication**. It uses one or two transmission lines to send and receive data across different devices. We've already seen the Serial Monitor in your Arduino IDE, where it receives and displays Serial output from your Arduino boards.

Because serial communication is a lot to think about in the beginning, follow the reading below as best you can. It can help to get different explanations for the same thing. This week you will just read about the concepts. In class we will go over together how to put it into action. You can of course feel free to try it out yourself as well.
