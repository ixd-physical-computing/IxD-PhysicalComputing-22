## Sensor and Project research

### Sensor research

Check out the [list of parts](https://violand.notion.site/list-of-parts-e8353dc1e6f54e32b98c6bf8c4bc7e55) of what we have in stock in the office, and look into one (or more) new sensors you've never tried before, or find your own new sensors to learn about.

You can click into links of the sensors for information, data sheets, and sometimes example circuits and code (if they link to Adafruit or Sparkfun websites). Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/380351140) about reading data sheet, an important way of learning about new sensors. Write down what you discovered in your blog, including answers to the questions below.

- What does the sensor do? How does the sensor work?
- Include the circuit diagram and example code or tutorials for the sensor.
- What are current and potential use of the sensor?
- If you were to build a project with this sensor, what would it be?

Here's a good sensor research [example](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/tangible-interaction/2018/02/20/softpot/), Softpot by Lauren Race.

For extra credit, if you want to, get one from us and play around with it.

### Project research

Find a piece of media art you like and write about it in your blog. Pick something with a physical interface or sensing system of some kind (i.e. not solely screen based). Include a summary with images and/or video, describe the viewer/user experience, and as much as you can figure out about how it's made.

If you need inspiration on what to write about, look through posts on [Hello Circuit](https://hellocircuits.com/resources/#otherwork), or find any other project you feel would be a good subject for Physical Computing.
