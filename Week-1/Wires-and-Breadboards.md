## Lab: Wires and Breadboards

### Working with wire

Read [this guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/working-with-wire/all) on different types of wires. Try [stripping a solid-core wire](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/working-with-wire/how-to-strip-a-wire)
with a manual wire stripper (skip other types as we only have manual wire strippers). Practice cutting and stripping a few.

❗️Wires of various colors are in the VFL supply cabinet. You can use whatever you want for free. If a certain type/color is running low, please alert a VFL staff.

### Working with breadboard

Learn about [breadboard internal connections](https://hellocircuits.com/2013/01/19/breadboard-internal-connections/). Practice plugging some wires
into your breadboard (distributed by TA), and using the continuity test feature on a multimeter to confirm connection of the wires.

Write down any questions in your blog!

_Note: you can attach a wire to anything else conductive like a metal water bottle, and then connect that to the breadboard, and then to a wire connected to anything else, plugged into the same row._
