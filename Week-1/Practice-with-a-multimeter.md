## Lab: Practice with a multimeter

Multimeters are available in the VFL (do not remove those from the 7th Floor), as well as in our 3rd Floor studio (do not remove those from the 3rd Floor). You can get resistors from the VFL electronics cabinet or scavenge some in the 3rd Floor strudio (you can keep those).

1. Practice [reading continuity](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/continuity)
2. Practice [reading voltage](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/measuring-voltage)
   (use a battery instead of the power circuit board shown in the tutorial)
3. Practice [reading resistor values with the multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/measuring-resistance) and reading [resistor color code chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code). Did you read the same values?
4. Now, find different kinds of objects and test their conductivity - the lower its resistance, the better conductor it is. Copper wires, for example, have very low resistance, and are thus excellent conductors. But what about a fork or a belt buckle? What about your own skin, dry and wet? What about water? (Hint: try adding salt to it!)
