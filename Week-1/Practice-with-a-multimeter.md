Multimeters will be distributed to groups (1 per 3 people) by the class TA. More are available in the VFL (do not remove those from the 7th Floor). There are also a few in the tool chest in our 3rd Floor studio (do not remove those from the 3rd Floor!).
A few assorted resistors will be distributed, there are more in the VFL supply cabinet (you can keep those).
1. Practice [reading continuity](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/continuity)
2. Practice [reading voltage](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/measuring-voltage)
 (use a battery instead of the power circuit board shown in the tutorial)
3. Practice [reading resistor values with the multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/measuring-resistance) and a confirm by reading [resistor color code chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code)
4. Now, find different kinds of objects and test their conductivity - the lower its resistance, the better conductor it is. Copper wires, for example, have very low resistance, and are thus excellent conductors. What about a fork or a belt buckle? What about your own skin, dry and wet? What about water? (Hint: try adding salt to it!)
