### ✨ Week 1: Introductions and Electronics (due 9/15)

Welcome to physical computing! In this first session, we'll overview the course, discuss interactive systems, and introduce basic electronics terminologies and concepts:

- What is physical interaction? Differences between inplicit and explicit interactions.
- Examples of physical computing projects (Biggest hits)
- Electronics 101: Electricity, components, schematics, prototyping board, multimeter

#### Assignment:

- Use [this form](https://forms.gle/cp9gk1ZpJuEViTJq9) to submit a link to your blog. You can use your personal blog, or create a new one to document school work if you wish. Make sure to create a category or tag for "Physical Computing" work, and assign it to all posts for this class.
- Lab: [Practice with a multimeter](Week-1/Practice-with-a-multimeter.html)
- Lab: [Wires and Breadboards](Week-1/Wires-and-Breadboards.html)
- Project: [Homemade Switch](Week-1/Home-made-switch.html)

#### Read and Watch:

- Forest Mims, **Getting Started with Electronics** 13-page excerpt, though highly recommend reading the whole book.
- Tom Igoe & Dan O'Sullivan, **Physical Computing: Sensing and Controlling the Physical World with Computers**. Out-dated in parts but still a great introduction to fundamentals. Read the following chapters:
  - Introduction
  - Ch 1 Electricity
  - Ch 3 Building Circuits
    (ignore the serial connector part on page 43).
- Sparkfun tutorials on [Basic Electricity: Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law)

...

### ✨ Week 2: Microcontrollers (due 9/22)
