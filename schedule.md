### âœ¨ Week 1: Introductions and Electronics

Welcome to physical computing! In this first session, we'll overview the course, discuss interactive systems, and introduce basic electronics terminologies and concepts:

- What is physical interaction? Differences between inplicit and explicit interactions.
- Examples of physical computing projects (Biggest hits)
- Electronics 101: Electricity, components, schematics, prototyping board, multimeter

Lecture slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IMX5nqnP6cakpM9MA19QoI0xWsFofZ4sm6MMcQsdkTg/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Assignments (due 9/15):

- Use [this form](https://forms.gle/cp9gk1ZpJuEViTJq9) to submit a link to your blog. You can use your personal blog, or create a new one to document school work if you wish. Make sure to create a category or tag for "Physical Computing" work, and assign it to all posts for this class.
- Lab: [Practice with a multimeter](Week-1/Practice-with-a-multimeter.html)
