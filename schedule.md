### ✨ Week 1: Introductions and Electronics

Welcome to physical computing! In this first session, we'll overview the course, discuss interactive systems, and introduce basic electronics terminologies and concepts:

- What is physical interaction? Differences between inplicit and explicit interactions.
- Examples of physical computing projects (Biggest hits)
- Electronics 101: Electricity, components, schematics, prototyping board, multimeter

#### Assignments (due 9/15):

- Use [this form](https://forms.gle/cp9gk1ZpJuEViTJq9) to submit a link to your blog. You can use your personal blog, or create a new one to document school work if you wish. Make sure to create a category or tag for "Physical Computing" work, and assign it to all posts for this class.
- Lab: [Practice with a multimeter](Week-1/Practice-with-a-multimeter.html)
- Lab: [Wires and Breadboards](Week-1/Wires-and-Breadboards.html)
- Project: [Homemade Switch](Week-1/Home-made-switch.html)

#### Read and Watch:

- Forest Mims, **Getting Started with Electronics**. 13-page excerpt, though highly recommend reading the whole book.
  - Pages 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31
- Tom Igoe & Dan O'Sullivan, **Physical Computing: Sensing and Controlling the Physical World with Computers**. Out-dated in parts but still a great introduction to fundamentals. Read the following chapters:
  - Introduction
  - Ch 1 Electricity
  - Ch 3 Building Circuits
    (ignore the serial connector part on page 43).
- Sparkfun tutorials on [Basic Electricity: Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law)

...

### ✨ Week 2: Microcontrollers

- Homework discussion: share your switch projects, and go over questions about electronics or anything that came up.
- Switches: tangible and intangible
- Microcontroller boards, programming environment, programming loops and logics
- In-class lab: Digital Input + Output

Lecture slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qjM1ZCWfOvU7s9u7IPR_hCbj2E3cmpDB40TPoyh8mAg/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Assignments (due 9/22):

- Lab: [Arduino basics](Week-2/Arduino-basics.html)
- Lab: [Variable resistor sensors](Week-2/Variable-resistor-sensors.html)
- Project: [Enhanced homemade switch](Week-2/Enhanced-homemade-switch.html)
- Remember to blog about your labs and projects, any questions, findings and more.

#### Read and Watch:

- Brian W. Evans, **Arduino Programming Notebook v6**. Page 7-12: structure, variables, datatype
- Optional - Charles Platt, **Make: Electronics**
  - Introduction & Chapter 1: Experiencing Electricity

...
