## Serial Output Lab

This week we covered Serial Communication - It's a lot of information to chew on, we'll resume next week to clarify and do more. Review the [week 5 lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SWo6lEEp1WgR5B6kxlWtKhT3AZTuQrvWmHjWDj5lxUg/edit#slide=id.g15f148ef1d0_0_0), and note any question you have.

In class we did the Async Serial Output Lab I (pp. 11 - 21). We've added in more instructional materials, review the lab, and move on to try the Async Serial Output Lab II (pp. 22 - 30), where you'd send two values from the Arduino.

Try to combine your own sketch you made for the [p5.js Lab](p5js-lab.html) with some Serial interaction! You can always copy the entire Serial section and just change the `serialEvent()` function. Work with your midterm group if it makes it easier.
