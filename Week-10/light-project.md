## Project: Let there be Light

Working in groups with LED strips, redesign an existing light, or build your own fixture or object. It can be a desk lamp, wall sconce, night light, lantern, flashlight, artificial candle, or an imaginative fictional device. Think about the activities of the space you're building it for -- is it used in the bedroom, the kitchen, a hospital waiting room, a night club, a flower shop, a spaceship?

Your light should:

- Be able to change (turn on and off, switch between different settings, adjust colors, fade in and out, change blink speed, or a combination of some of them) based on some kind of sensor input. Design the interaction and interface with users in mind: Who would be using the light? What behaviors are expected of the user? How do those movements reflect in the changes of light? Are these implicit (passive) or explicit (active) interactions?

- Have a color scheme that are specific to the design, the environment, and the mood you're trying to convey. No rainbow color scrolling please (unless it's intended) you're all designers here.

- Enclosed with some kind of shade of [diffuser](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuser_(optics)>), so that your light strips are not exposed outside directly. It can as easy as putting the strip into an existing box, bottle, paper lantern, etc., or you can make your own enclosure as well. Experiment with different materials: matte, glossy, semi-transparent, reflective, and see how they affect the look of the light. Remember that paper can be really good diffusers!

As always, it doesn't have to be very complex, but try to make it look neat. Document your work on your blog! Include sketches, diagrams, schematics, code, process photos, questions, and photos and video of working result.
