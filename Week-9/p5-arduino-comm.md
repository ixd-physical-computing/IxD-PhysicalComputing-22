## Project: Serial Communication Application!

Collaborating in groups, you will make one demonstration of communicating between Arduino and p5.js (or Processing). You have two options:

Option 1 - Arduino to p5.js, an application that uses 3 inputs to emulate mouse (mouseX, mouseY, clicking) behaviors.

Option 2 - p5.js to Arduino, using mouseX, mouseY or anything else to control something (light, buzzer, motor?). Reference to the Optional [lab](p5-serial-out.html) this week for an example.

It can - and should! - be simple, but your piece should demonstrate a good (or funny) reason for existing, e.g. it does something with its physicality that could not be done well with just the screen, or vice versa.

You can incorporate switches, potentiometers, photocells, IR sensors, sound sensors, LEDs, and/or anything else you can find. Use creative construction in your physical forms. Try to keep your wiring neat! You can adapt your earlier homework assignments if you like.

As always, document your work on your blog! Include sketches, diagrams, schematics, code, process photos, and photos and video of working result.
