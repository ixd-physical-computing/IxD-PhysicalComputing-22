Getting started with the basics of Arduino/Redboard.

Go over this week's [lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qjM1ZCWfOvU7s9u7IPR_hCbj2E3cmpDB40TPoyh8mAg/edit?usp=sharing), get familiar with the topics covered: overview the pinouts of Redboard, download the Arduino IDE Software, and review the blink example as well as the Digital I/O lab. If anything's unclear, use the following resources:

1. Arduino Introduction: [What is Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)

2. Programming environment: [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Environment)

3. Sparkfun Inventor's Kit printed book, intro (page 4-9)

Next, using the Sparkfun Inventor's Kit printed book, and complete the following exercises. Note that all of their project code can be downloaded from [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/SIKcode). Clicking on each link there's also a digital version of each exercise, including the code used.

1. Circuit 1A, [Blink an LED](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v41/circuit-1a-blink-an-led) (page 13-19). 
  
    This is similar to the blink example we learned in class, but using a physical LED instead of the onboard one.

2. Circuit 1B, [Potentiometer](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v41/circuit-1a-blink-an-led) (page 20-25).

    In this exercise, you'll be using a potentiometer, a variable resistor, as the analog input. Read through the instruction before trying out the circuit, you'll learn about Analog Inputs and Voltage Dividers. Note any questions and write them down in your blog. You'll be going over more about analog inputs in the next lab.
