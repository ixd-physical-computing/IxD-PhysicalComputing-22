Enhance or transform your homemade switch using something you've learned from this week! You can either work in your original group, or create something completely new by yourself.

Remember to draw a schematic of your circuit. Refer to the [Resources](https://hellocircuits.com/resources/) page, and first half of [this tutorials](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-read-a-schematic) to find symbols for different components. You can draw by hand and photograph to put on your blog, or you can use a software like [Fritzing](www.fritzing.org).

Some ideas on what you can add to the project:

- Try using some analog (i.e. varying) input to affect the LEDs! For example, incorporate something besides an on/off switch - rotation, bending, sliding. Or try to combine a switch with an analog input. Invent a reason to take advantage of a non-binary input. Or try reimagining something you see in the world around you, but with a richer input than a button or switch. 
- Adding an Arduino in between your switch and the LED output. You can animate the LEDs, map the analog input, create multiple switch combinations. If you need help, ask your programming teachers, and post on both class Slack channels. 
- And of course you can certainly do both!

All of the above can be quite light in terms of finish and polish, its main purpose is to get you used to translating stuff from controlled tutorial environments, which you think you know, to the real world and your own ideas, where you can suddenly discover you don't in fact know. Do, however, try to make your wiring as neat as possible, to make debugging easier, and to set good design and fabrication standards early.
 
Post documentation of what you make on your blog!
