Working with your group from last week, enhance or transform your homemade switch using something you've learned from this week!

Remember to draw a schematic of your circuit. Refer to first half of [this tutorials](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-read-a-schematic) to find symbols for different components. You can draw by hand and photograph to put on your blog, or you can use a software like [Fritzing](www.fritzing.org).

Some ideas on what you can add to the project:

- Try using some analog inputs (variable resistance sensors) to affect the LEDs! For example, incorporate interactions besides tapping on and off - rotation, bending, sliding. Or try to combine a switch with an additional analog input. Invent a reason to take advantage of a non-binary input, or reimagine an interaction with a richer input than a button or switch.
- Adding an Arduino in between your switch and the LED output. You can animate the LEDs, map the analog input, create multiple switch combinations. If you need help, ask us or your programming teachers, and post on our class Slack channel.
- And of course you can certainly do both!

All of the above can be quite light in terms of finish and polish, its main purpose is to get you used to translating stuff from controlled tutorial environments, to the real world and your own ideas. Do, however, try to make your wiring as neat as possible, to make debugging easier, and to set good design and fabrication standards early.

Post documentation on your blog of course!
