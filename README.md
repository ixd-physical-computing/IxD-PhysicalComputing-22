## Class Description

This course is a practical, hands-on exploration of physically interactive technology for the designer. Students will examine how to interface objects and installations with the viewer's body and ambient stimuli, such as motion, light, sound and intangible data. Starting with the basics using the open-source Arduino platform, the class will move through electrical theory, circuit design, microcontroller programming and sensors, as well as complex output, including motors, video and intercommunication between objects. Note: No previous programming or electronics experience is required.


## Week 1: Introductions and Electronics

Class Notes:

### Assignment:

- Add the URL of your blog to "student blog list" (link). You can use your personal blog, or create a new one to document school work if you wish. Make sure to use a blog category or tag for "Physical Computing" work, and assign it to all posts for this class. 
- Lab: [Practice with a multimeter](https://viololahe.github.io/SVA-IxD-PhysicalComputing-22/Week-1/Practice-with-a-multimeter.html)
- Lab: Wires and Breadboards (link)
- Project: Home Made Switch (link)

### Read and Watch:
- Forest Mims, __Getting Started with Electronics__. A classic book, reading the whole thing highly recommended, for now read this short 13 page excerpt (missing link)
- Tom Igoe &  Dan O'Sullivan, __Physical Computing: Sensing and Controlling the Physical World with Computers__. Out-dated in parts but still a great introduction to fundamentals. 
  - Introduction (missing link)
  - Ch 1 Electricity (missing link)
  - Ch 3 Building Circuits (missing link) 
(ignore the serial connector on page 43, it's out-dated).
- Sparkfun tutorials on [Basic Electricity: Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law)


## Week 2: Microcontrollers
