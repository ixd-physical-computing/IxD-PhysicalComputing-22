## Class Description

This course is a practical, hands-on exploration of physically interactive technology for designers. Students will examine how to interface objects and installations with the viewer's body and ambient stimuli, such as motion, light, sound and intangible data. Starting with the basics using the open-source Arduino platform, the class will move through electrical theory, circuit design, microcontroller programming and sensors, as well as complex output, including motors, video and intercommunication between objects. *Note: No previous programming or electronics experience is required.*


## Week 1: Introductions and Electronics

### Class Notes:
Welcome to physical computing! In this class we'll overview the course, discuss interactive systems, and introduce basic electronics terminologies and concepts.
- What is physical interaction? Differences between inplicit and explicit interactions.
- Examples of physical computing (Biggest hits)
- Basic Electronics: Electricity, components, schematics, prototyping board, multimeter

### Read and Watch:
- Forest Mims, __Getting Started with Electronics__. A classic book, reading the whole thing highly recommended, for now read this short 13 page excerpt (missing link)
- Tom Igoe &  Dan O'Sullivan, __Physical Computing: Sensing and Controlling the Physical World with Computers__. Out-dated in parts but still a great introduction to fundamentals. 
  - Introduction (missing link)
  - Ch 1 Electricity (missing link)
  - Ch 3 Building Circuits (missing link) 
(ignore the serial connector on page 43, it's out-dated).
