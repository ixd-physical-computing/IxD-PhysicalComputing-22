Syllabus for SVA MFA Interaction Design first year course, The Fundamentals of Physical Computing

## Week 1: Introductions and Electronics

Class Notes:

### Assignment:

- Add the URL of your blog to "student blog list" (link). You can use your personal blog, or create a new one to document school work if you wish. Make sure to use a blog category or tag for "Physical Computing" work, and assign it to all posts for this class. 
- Lab: [Practice with a multimeter](https://viololahe.github.io/SVA-IxD-PhysicalComputing-22/Week-1/Practice-with-a-multimeter.html)
- Lab: Wires and Breadboards (link)
- Project: Home Made Switch (link)

### Read and Watch:
- Forest Mims, __Getting Started with Electronics__. A classic book, reading the whole thing highly recommended, for now read this short 13 page excerpt (missing link)
- Tom Igoe &  Dan O'Sullivan, __Physical Computing: Sensing and Controlling the Physical World with Computers__. Out-dated in parts but still a great introduction to fundamentals. 
  - Introduction (missing link)
  - Ch 1 Electricity (missing link)
  - Ch 3 Building Circuits (missing link) 
(ignore the serial connector on page 43, it's out-dated).
- Sparkfun tutorials on [Basic Electricity: Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law)


## Week 2: Microcontrollers
