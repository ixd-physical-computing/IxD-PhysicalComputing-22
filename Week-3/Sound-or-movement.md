## Project 2: Sound or Movement

Based on what you learned from the labs this week, create a simple application with either sound or movement as an output.

### Working with Sound

Making a musical instrument is always a good way of utilizing auditory outputs, but think about ways to make the interaction or interface interesting. Do you need to squeeze something, touch something, rotate something, hold hands with your friend? Think about implicit and explicit interactions, how do your users know what they're doing is impacting the sound, and in what way? Also: anything can sing! It doesn't have to look or feel like an instrument at all either. Utilize something you already have and make them sing would also be a great approach.

If you're interested in producing some kind of melody, look into [this tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/toneMelody) for adding and using a pitches library.

### Working with Movement

The most challenging part of working with motors is going to be attatchment and mechanisms. There are many simple machines you can design to create different types of movements, Rob Ive's [Mechanism page](https://www.robives.com/mechanism/) is a great resource. Of course, it can be as simple or as you want it to be, for example, a [sunflower rotating towards the light](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Mako_/arduino-sunflower-c4fd84?ref=tag&ref_id=servo&offset=1), a monster opening and closing its mouth if you feed it. Using lighter materials help too!

Like last week, your project can be quite light in terms of finish and polish, but do try to make your wiring as neat as possible. Try soldering if you haven't, watch this [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qps9woUGkvI) or read this [comic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_w3QaK71HDD8ipvT3ry6TKAMcCHSOdG/view?usp=sharing) for helpful tips, or book office hours with Viola if you need help!

Post documentation of your design, schematic, process, and what you make on your blog.
