## Project 2: Sound or Movement

Based on what you learned from the labs this week, create a simple application with either sound or movement as an output. Having multiple inputs would be a good challenge for this project; it's a good way to practing using `if()` statements and boolean logics to create different conditions for different outputs.

### Working with Sound

Making a musical instrument is always a good way of utilizing auditory outputs, but think about ways to make the interaction or interface interesting. Do you need to squeeze something, touch something, rotate something, hold hands with your friend? Think about implicit and explicit interactions, how do your users know what they're doing is impacting the sound, and in what way?

Also: anything can sing or make noise! It can be a puzzle box, an alarm, a plant that gently buzzes... It doesn't have to look or feel or behave like an instrument. Utilize something you already have and make them sing would also be a great approach.

If you're interested in producing some kind of melody, look into [this tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/toneMelody) for adding and using a pitches library.

### Working with Movement

Servo motors are powerful little things -- They can be used to push buttons, lift things up, rotate things around, uhh, [pat people??](https://fletcherbach.com/FRSK04)... and many other ways to create movements.

The most challenging part of working with motors is going to be attatchment and mechanisms. There are many simple machines you can design to create different types of movements, Rob Ive's [Mechanism page](https://www.robives.com/mechanism/) is a great resource. Of course, it can be as simple or as you want it to be, for example, a [sunflower rotating towards the light](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Mako_/arduino-sunflower-c4fd84?ref=tag&ref_id=servo&offset=1), a monster opening and closing its mouth if you feed it, etc. Using lighter materials help too!

Like last week, your project can be quite light in terms of finish and polish, but do try to make your wiring as neat as possible. Try soldering if you haven't, watch this [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qps9woUGkvI), this [header pin tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkjMK26ROcM), or read this [comic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_w3QaK71HDD8ipvT3ry6TKAMcCHSOdG/view?usp=sharing) for helpful tips. Ask VFL staff, or book office hours with Viola if you need help! We will practice in class more.

Tip: solder male header pins to any stranded wire or switches or sensors that don't have wire ends made to fit into an Arduino or breadboard. It's a good idea to do this with any thin or stranded wire. There should be header pins in the VFL, ask staff if not.

Post documentation of your design, schematic, process, and what you make on your blog.
