Servo Motor Control

Servo motors are the easiest output device to make motion with a microcontroller. Most common servo motors (like the one that comes in your kit) can turn 180 degrees. Read more about them using this [Sparkfun guide](https://www.sparkfun.com/servos). Next, follow [this example](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hobby-servo-tutorial?_ga=2.57713834.1061003023.1664014266-305460748.1661811385#controlling-a-servo-with-arduino) to hook up a servo, and drive it, from an Arduino board.

Using the Sparkfun Inventor's Kit printed book, and complete Circuit 3A, [Servo Motors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v41/circuit-3a-servo-motors) (page 53-59). Note that all of their project code can be downloaded from [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/SIKcode). Clicking on the link of each exercise, there's also a digital version, including the code used.
