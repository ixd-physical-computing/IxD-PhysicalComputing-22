### Tone Output

Go over this week's [lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NRexncxBzfuWql_G8BflpLfZFYYmzwMUmk9-ZwswJrI/edit#slide=id.pg), get familiar with the topics covered: different sensors, comparison operators, boolean operators, variables, data type, and review the Analog I/O lab. If anything's unclear, note them in your blog.

### Making Sound

Sound waves are vibrations. When the speed of the vibration fall under a certain range of frequencies (measured in herz, or Hz), they become audible pitches to the human ear. An arduino is able to create sound if we attach a speaker or buzzer to an output pin, and turn it on and off at a certain frequency! To know more about how microcontrollers make sound, go through the introduction part of [sound basics](https://tigoe.github.io/SoundExamples/sound-basics.html) by Tom Igoe. Except ignore the parts about the speaker, as we're using a piezo buzzer, and its piezoelectric material changes shape when applyed electricity to it.

Using the Sparkfun Inventor's Kit printed book, and complete the following exercises. Note that all of their project code can be downloaded from [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/SIKcode). Clicking on each link there's also a digital version of each exercis, including the code used. Note any questions and write them down in your blog!

1. Circuit 2A, [Buzzer](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-2a-buzzer) (page 37-41).

   This is similar to the lab we did in class, but using a different interaction, and introducing an array as a coding concept.

2. Circuit 2B, [Digital Trumpet](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/circuit-2b-digital-trumpet) (page 42-46).
